# Bug

## Description
Currently, after running the application for an extended period of time the machines column will show either a "1" or a "0" for every field. We need to investigate why and fix the issue.

## Notes
All work should be done in the `api` and in the `client` there should be no need to touch the `generator` or `producer`
